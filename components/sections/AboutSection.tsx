        I'm Manasa Praveen â€” a curious builder obsessed with <span className="accent">data, design, and impact</span>. 
        I'm double majoring in Computer Science and Math with a minor in Econ, exploring where tech meets real-world change.
        Whether it's fintech dashboards or healthcare AI models, I want my code to make life a little smoother for others.
